# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

## The Problem Was Fixed! ✅

The frontend dependencies were missing. They are now installed.

## How to Run (Choose ONE method):

### Method 1: Easiest - Double-click the script
1. **Right-click** `start-all.ps1` → **Run with PowerShell**
2. Two windows will open automatically
3. Wait 10-15 seconds for servers to start
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

### Method 2: Manual (Step by Step)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
npm start
```
Wait for: `Backend server running on http://localhost:4000`

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Wait for: `Local: http://localhost:5173` (or similar)

**Then:** Open that URL in your browser!

## Login Credentials:
- Student: `student1` / `pass123`
- Admin: `admin1` / `pass123`

## Still Not Working?

1. **Check both terminals are running** - you need BOTH servers running
2. **Use the EXACT URL** shown in the frontend terminal (might be 5174, 5175, etc.)
3. **Check Windows Firewall** - allow Node.js if prompted
4. **Close and restart** both terminals if needed

## What Was Fixed:
- ✅ Frontend dependencies installed
- ✅ Backend dependencies verified
- ✅ Startup scripts created
- ✅ All files verified correct
